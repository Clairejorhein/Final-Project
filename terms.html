            <p>This Services Agreement (the "Agreement") contains the complete terms and conditions which govern your
                subscription of Website Design, Development and other Internet-related services provided by JS-Solutions

                <br><br>
                The following terms and conditions apply to all website development / design services provided by
                PH Island Adventures to the Client.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Acceptance</h5>
                It is not necessary for any Client to have signed an acceptance of these terms and conditions for them
                to apply. If a Client accepts a quote then the Client will be deemed to have satisfied themselves as to
                the terms applying and have accepted these terms and conditions in full.
                <br><br>
                Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Any purchase or use of our services implies that you
                have read and accepted our terms and conditions.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Charges</h5>
                Charges for services to be provided by PH Island Adventures are defined in the project quotation that
                the Client receives via e-mail. Quotations are valid for a period of 30 days. PH Island Adventures
                reserves the right to alter or decline to provide a quotation after expiry of the 30 days.
                <br><br>
                Unless agreed otherwise with the Client, all website design services require an advance payment of a
                minimum of fifty (50) percent of the project quotation total before the work is supplied to the Client
                for review. The remaining fifty (50) percent of the project quotation total due upon completion of the
                work, prior to upload to the server or release of materials.
                <br><br>
                Payment for services is due by cheque or bank transfer. Cheques should be made payable to JS-Solutions
                Networks Pte Ltd and sent to PH Island Adventures Pte Ltd. Bank details will be made available on
                invoices.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Client Review</h5>
                PH Island Adventures will provide the Client with an opportunity to review the appearance and content
                of the website during the design phase and once the overall website development is completed. At the
                completion of the project, such materials will be deemed to be accepted and approved unless the Client
                notifies PH Island Adventures otherwise within ten (10) days of the date the materials are made
                available to the Client.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Turnaround Time and Content Control</h5>
                PH Island Adventures will install and publicly post or supply the Client's website by the date
                specified in the project proposal, or at date agreed with Client upon PH Island Adventures receiving
                initial payment, unless a delay is specifically requested by the Client and agreed by JS-Solutions
                Networks.
                <br><br>
                In return, the Client agrees to delegate a single individual as a primary contact to aid JS-Solutions
                Networks with progressing the commission in a satisfactory and expedient manner.
                <br><br>
                During the project, PH Island Adventures will require the Client to provide website content; text,
                images, movies and sound files
                <br><br>
                <h5>Failure to provide required website content:</h5>
                PH Island Adventures is a small business, to remain efficient we must ensure that work we have
                programmed is carried out at the scheduled time. On occasions we may have to reject offers for other
                work and enquiries to ensure that your work is completed at the time arranged.
                <br><br>
                This is why we ask that you provide all the required information in advance. On any occasion where
                progress cannot be made with your website because we have not been given the required information in the
                agreed time frame, and we are delayed as result, we reserve the right to impose a surcharge.
                <br><br>
                If you agree to provide us with the required information and subsequently fail to do within two week of
                project commencement we reserve the right to close the project and the balance remaining becomes payable
                immediately.
                <br><br>
                NOTE: Text content should be delivered as a Microsoft Word, email (or similar) document with the pages
                in the supplied document representing the content of the relevant pages on your website.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Payment</h5>
                Invoices will be provided by PH Island Adventures upon completion but before publishing the live
                website. Invoices are normally sent via email; however, the Client may choose to receive hard copy
                invoices. Invoices are due upon receipt.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Additional Expenses</h5>
                Client agrees to reimburse PH Island Adventures for any additional expenses necessary for the
                completion of the work. Examples would be purchase of special fonts, stock photography etc.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Web Browsers</h5>
                PH Island Adventures makes every effort to ensure websites are designed to be viewed by the majority of
                visitors. Websites are designed to work with the most popular current browsers (e.g. Firefox, Internet
                Explorer, Google Chrome, etc.). Client agrees that PH Island Adventures cannot guarantee correct
                functionality with all browser software across different operating systems.
                <br><br>                
                PH Island Adventures cannot accept responsibility for web pages which do not display acceptably in new
                versions of browsers released after the website have been designed and handed over to the Client. As
                such, PH Island Adventures reserves the right to quote for any work involved in changing the website
                design or website code for it to work with updated browser software.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Default</h5>
                Accounts unpaid thirty (30) days after the date of invoice will be considered in default. If the Client
                in default maintains any information or files on PH Island Adventures's Web space, JS-Solutions
                Networks will, at its discretion, remove all such material from its web space. PH Island Adventures is
                not responsible for any loss of data incurred due to the removal of the service. Removal of such
                material does not relieve the Client of the obligation to pay any outstanding charges assessed to the
                Client's account. Cheques returned for insufficient funds will result in the Client's account being
                immediately be considered to be in default until full payment is received. Clients with accounts in
                default agree to pay PH Island Adventures reasonable expenses, including legal fees and costs for
                collection by third-party agencies, incurred by PH Island Adventures in enforcing these Terms and
                Conditions.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Termination</h5>
                Termination of services by the Client must be requested in a written notice and will be effective on
                receipt of such notice. Telephone requests for termination of services will not be honoured until and
                unless confirmed in writing. The Client will be invoiced for work completed to the date of first notice
                of cancellation for payment in full within thirty (30) days.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Indemnity</h5>
                All PH Island Adventures services may be used for lawful purposes only. You agree to indemnify and hold
                PH Island Adventures harmless from any claims resulting from your use of our service that damages you
                or any other party.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Copyright</h5>
                The Client retains the copyright to data, files and graphic logos provided by the Client, and grants
                PH Island Adventures the rights to publish and use such material. The Client must obtain permission and
                rights to use any information or files that are copyrighted by a third party. The Client is further
                responsible for granting PH Island Adventures permission and rights for use of the same and agrees to
                indemnify and hold harmless PH Island Adventures from any and all claims resulting from the Client's
                negligence or inability to obtain proper copyright permissions. A contract for website design and/or
                placement shall be regarded as a guarantee by the Client to PH Island Adventures that all such
                permissions and authorities have been obtained. Evidence of permissions and authorities may be
                requested.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Media Delivery</h5>
                Unless otherwise specified in the project quotation, this Agreement assumes that any text will be
                provided by the Client in electronic format (ASCII text files delivered on thumbdrive, CD or via e-mail
                or FTP) and that all photographs and other graphics will be provided physically in high quality print
                suitable for scanning or electronically in .gif, .jpeg, .png or .tiff format. Although every reasonable
                attempt shall be made by PH Island Adventures to return to the Client any images or printed material
                provided for use in creation of the Client's website, such return cannot be guaranteed.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Design Credit</h5>
                A link to PH Island Adventures will appear in either small type or by a small graphic at the bottom of
                the Client's website. If a graphic is used, it will be designed to fit in with the overall site design.
                The Client also agrees that the website developed for the Client may be presented in PH Island Adventures's portfolio.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Access Requirements</h5>
                If the Client's website is to be installed on a third-party server, PH Island Adventures must be
                granted temporary read/write access to the Client's storage directories which must be accessible via
                FTP. Depending on the specific nature of the project, other resources might also need to be configured
                on the server.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Post-Placement Alterations</h5>
                PH Island Adventures cannot accept responsibility for any alterations caused by a third party occurring
                to the Client's pages once installed. Such alterations include, but are not limited to additions,
                modifications or deletions.
                <br><br>
                <h5>General</h5>
                These Terms and Conditions supersede all previous representations, understandings or agreements. The
                Client's signature below or payment of an advance fee constitutes agreement to and acceptance of these
                Terms and Conditions. Payment online is an acceptance of our terms and conditions.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Governing Law</h5>
                This Agreement shall be governed by Philippine Law.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Liability</h5>
                PH Island Adventures hereby excludes itself, its Employees and or Agents from all and any liability
                from:
                <br><br>
                Loss or damage caused by any inaccuracy;
                Loss or damage caused by omission;
                Loss or damage caused by delay or error, whether the result of negligence or other cause in the
                production of the web site;
                Loss or damage to clients' artwork/photos, supplied for the site. Immaterial whether the loss or damage
                results from negligence or otherwise.
                The entire liability of PH Island Adventures to the Client in respect of any claim whatsoever or breach
                of this Agreement, whether or not arising out of negligence, shall be limited to the charges paid for
                the Services under this Agreement in respect of which the breach has arisen.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Severability</h5>
                In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and the Agreement shall
                not be void for this reason alone. Such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by
                a mutually acceptable valid, legal and enforceable provision, which comes closest to the intention of
                the parties underlying the invalid.
                <br><br>
